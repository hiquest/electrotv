A TV shows tracker app build with React and Electron.  I called it `ElectroTV` because I'm that creative.

To use it you will need a `thetvdb.com` API key (can't share mine, sorry). Fortunately, [this is very easy](https://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=apiregister).

Install
=====

```bash
THETVDB_API_KEY=<KEY> yarn install && yarn start
```

I'm planning to post a step-by-step tutorial later. Stay tuned.
